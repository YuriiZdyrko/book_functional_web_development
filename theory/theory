The design they came up with is the supervisor Behaviour. 
It extracts error handling code from business logic into its own modules. 
Supervisor modules spawn supervisor processes that link to other processes and watch for failure, 
restarting those linked processes if they crash.
This separation of concerns makes our code clearer and easier to maintain. 
It keeps our business logic free of diversions for handling exceptions. 
We end up writing more confident code that assumes success, 
but supervisors always have our back when things go wrong.

--- Application Behaviour module ----

mix.exs: name, version, compile and run-time dependencies
application.ex: start top-level supervisor

To run application, not listed in deps:
def application do [extra_applications: [:logger],

To turn run-time application into compile-times:
defp deps do
  [{:some_new_dep, "> 0.0.0", runtime: false}]
end

Useful methods:
:application.which_applications

Start necessary dependencies:
:application.ensure_all_started(:islands_engine)

:application.start(:islands_engine)
:application.stop(:islands_engine)

Atom conversion:
Use String.to_existing_atom/1 to convert user-generated strings into atoms.
This prevents hacking attacks when user sends millions of strings, 
and memory overflows because atoms are not garbage collected.

TIP:
To overcome ** (Protocol.UndefinedError) protocol Jason.Encoder not implemented for %IslandsEngine.Island
Use inspect(board) when sending response to connect term to string.
